# DeskCommon
DeskCommon is a dynamic Cocoa Touch framework that provides common code for Deskâ€™s various iOS projects.

## Installation
DeskCommon supports multiple methods for installing the framework in a project.

### Installation with CocoaPods
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries in your projects.

You can install it with the following command:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  pod 'DeskCommon', '~>1.0'
end
```
Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Installation with Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate DeskCommon into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "forcedotcom/DeskCommon-Cocoa" ~> 1.0
```
Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `DeskCommon.framework` into your Xcode project.

**IMPORTANT: Currently we only support prebuilt frameworks. If you run carthage with `--no-use-binaries` option, you will get an error.**

### Installation using prebuilt Framework
Starting DeskCommon version `1.1.0`, prebuilt frameworks are attached in github releases. In order to use prebuilt framework, download the appropriate version from [Releases](https://github.com/forcedotcom/DeskCommon-Cocoa/releases), unarchive the zip file and drag `DeskCommon.framework` into your Xcode project.

**IMPORTANT: Attached prebuilt frameworks contains a binaries which has been built for a number of architectures `(x86_64, i386, armv7, arm64)`. According to [this radar](http://www.openradar.me/radar?id=6409498411401216) before submission to AppStore you must strip off simulator slices `(x86_64, i386)`.**
